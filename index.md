Finding and downloading deleted Tweets takes a lot of time. Thankfully, with this tool, it becomes a piece of cake! ðŸŽ‚

Twayback is a portmanteau of *Twitter* and the *Wayback Machine*. Enter your desired Twitter username, and let Twayback do the rest!

## Features
 - Can download some or all of a user's archived deleted Tweets.
 - Lets you extract Tweets text to a text file (yes, even quote retweets!)
 - Allows custom time range to narrow search for deleted Tweets archived between two dates.
 - Differentiates between accounts that are active, suspended, or don't/no longer exist.
 - Lets you know if a target handle's archived Tweets have been excluded from the Wayback Machine.

## Usage
    twayback -u USERNAME [OPTIONS]
    Example: twayback -u jack
    
    -u, --username        Specify target user's Twitter handle
    -from, --fromdate     Narrow search for deleted Tweets *archived* on and after this date
                          (can be combined with -to)
                          (format YYMMDD)
    -to, --todate         Narrow search for deleted Tweets *archived* on and before this date
                          (can be combined with -from)
                          (format YYMMDD)

## Things to keep in mind
 - Quality of the HTML files depends on how the Wayback Machine saved them. Some are better than others.
 - This tool is best for text. You might have some luck with photos. You cannot download videos.
 - By definition, if an account is suspended or no longer exists, all their Tweets would be considered deleted.
 - Custom date range is not about when Tweets were made, but rather when they were _archived_. For example, a Tweet from 2011 may have been archived today.
